# Blue Retro AIO PCBs
This is a collection of PCBs that I made to work with darthcloud's BlueRetro Project. (https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro)  The PCB's were created in Eagle and I have included the Gerbers if you would like to create them yourself. 

Currently I have NES, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Sega Saturn, 3DO, PSX/PS2 and PCEngine/Turbografx 16 complete. 

I have created NeoGeo (Parallel 1P both PP and OD), Atari 2600 (Parallel 2P both PP and OD), SG-1000/Sega Master System (Parallel 2P both PP and OD), Genesis (No Multitap), SNES, CD-i, Jaguar, PC-FX and Dreamcast but have not tested them as I do not have the sytems.

I am working through Virtual Boy but need to find a cost efficient way to connect it to the Virtual Boy as I am not consolizing mine.  

Here is the current status of all systems:

The Housing CAD is complete for the systems listed above and I will start on the additional systems in the near future
