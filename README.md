# Blue Retro AIO PCBs
This is a collection of PCBs that I made to work with darthcloud's BlueRetro Project. (https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro)  The PCB's were created in Eagle and I have included the Gerbers if you would like to build them yourself. 

I have created PCB's for all supported systems with the exception of JVS.  An issue has been created for each of the systems that need testing.  If you make one please comment in the related issue on any progress/issues.

Currently, I am working on the Virtual Boy PCB, but need to find a cost efficient controller plug (I am not consolizing mine).  

Amaiorano wrote up a review for the variants that they built, you can read it here:

Current status of all systems:
