# Blue Retro AIO PCBs
This is a collection of PCBs that I made to work with darthcloud's BlueRetro Project. (https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro)  The PCB's were created in Eagle and I have included the Gerbers if you would like to create them yourself. 

Currently I have Gamecube, 3DO and PCEngine/Turbografx 16 complete and verified. I have PCBs enroute for Saturn, Nintendo 64, Virtual Boy, PSX/PS2 and NES. Once they are verified I will merge the branch.  

Please post any requests for a PCB from darthcloud's list and I am happy to make it.
