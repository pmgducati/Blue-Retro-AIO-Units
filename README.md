# Blue Retro AIO PCBs
This is a collection of PCBs that I made to work with darthcloud's BlueRetro Project. (https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro)  The PCB's were created in Eagle and I have included the Gerbers if you would like to create them yourself. 

I have created PCB's for all the other supported systems with the exception of JVS (In Progess) but have not tested them as I do not have the sytems.  I have created a issue for each of the systems that I do not have to test.  If you make one please comment in the related issue on any progress/problems.

I am working through Virtual Boy but need to find a cost efficient way to connect it to the Virtual Boy as I am not consolizing mine.  

Here is the current status of all systems:
