# Blue Retro AIO PCBs
This is a collection of PCBs that I made to work with darthcloud's BlueRetro Project. (https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro)  The PCB's were created in Eagle and I have included the Gerbers if you would like to create them yourself. 

Currently I have NES, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Sega Saturn, 3DO, PSX/PS2 and PCEngine/Turbografx 16 complete. 

I have created PCB's for all the other supported systems with the exception of Atari7800 and JVS (Both in Progess) but have not tested them as I do not have the sytems.  I have created a issue for each of the systems that I do not have to test.  If you make one please comment in the related issue on any progress/problems.

I am working through Virtual Boy but need to find a cost efficient way to connect it to the Virtual Boy as I am not consolizing mine.  

Here is the current status of all systems:

The Housing CAD is complete for the systems listed above and I am working on the remainging cover variants for the remaning systems.

Here are some pics of the PCBs and Housings:
